The idea of Onion was birthed on the [RGH](https://discord.gg/Jd2azKX) discord server in January 2022, where two great minds, *Jim Gray and Shaun Inman*, jokingly came up with the name as a play on Shaun's own frontend project (Union, which later became MiniUI). Jim Gray started with improving the configuration of Miyoo's own frontend, *MainUI*, adding more emulators and rearranging image assets.

Totofaki joined the project soon after, and started developing the GameSwitcher and Activity Tracker. Within a short period of time he had shaped Onion into what we know it as today.
